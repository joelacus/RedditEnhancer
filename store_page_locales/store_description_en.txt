Enhance your Reddit experience with Reddit Enhancer! A browser extension that allows you to customise your Reddit page with just a few clicks.
Supports all versions of Reddit.

With Reddit Enhancer, you can:
• Resize the feed and post width for a better viewing experience.
• Customise theme colours and add a background wallpaper.
• Hide promoted and recommended posts, as well as reddit premium ads.
• Hide numerous other elements you don't use or want to see for a cleaner and less cluttered interface.
• Open images in a new tab on their own directly, rather than being embedded on a page.
• Scale tall images to fit within the post, or add a scrollbar to see the full width of the image and just scroll to see more.
• Scroll to the next root comment with a click of a button.
• Enable Bionic Reading for posts and comments, and/or change the font size, for faster and easier reading.
