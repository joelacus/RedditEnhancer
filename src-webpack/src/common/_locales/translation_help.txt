I welcome any help to improve translations, fix mistakes or add new languages.

Manual:

To add a new language, duplicate the (en) directory, and rename it with the two letter ISO 639 language code of the new language, then translate the "message" values.
Regional localisations can also be added by appending the region code. For example, "en-GB" for British English.
Any missing translations in regional files will fall back to the non regional locale, so only differences are required.
Any missing translations in a locale file will default to the English translation.
The "extensionVersion" item is only needed in (en), so can be deleted.


Guided (Python script):

git clone git@github.com:joelacus/RedditEnhancer.git
cd RedditEnhancer/src-webpack
npm run lmt
Select "Add new translation", and then type the ISO 639 locale code.
Next, select "Find missing translations", and then select the newly added locale.
Enter the translation when prompted for each item.


Thank you :)
